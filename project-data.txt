-> So, This project is all about building the traditonal game of "Rock-Paper-Scissor"
-> Build Basic version of it...after your blockchain project is finished, build the advanced version of it using React and other frameworks.

--> So, My standards :-
    1. Make it look fucking professional. -_-
    2. No bugs or lag
    3. Build it from scratch.

=> What to do (steps) : -
    -> Color Combination :-
        1. Black and Yellow preferably...well see how it goes

          Pink Type : rgba(254,41,95,255)
          Yellor Type : rgba(255,213,0,255)
          Cyan Type : rgba(22,187,217,255)
          Body Background : rgb(255, 201, 0)
          Black Type : rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.89)

    -> Design the layout and stick to it
        1. Circle or square ?
        2. Centered on the web page....yep
    -> Use all advanced concept of javascript and make code looks easy.
        1. Use logics and make it simple, avoid unneccessary compexity.
        2. Do proper commenting

=> I Beleive it will take close to [5 hr] to build it.
    -> Try speeding up the process.
    -> Don't be nervous, you can do it. :) you are pro in blockchain....
       .....man you got your own records...you have your data..trust those
       data....relax. All is good. :)
